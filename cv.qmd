### Research Experience

#### Post-baccalaureate Research Assistant

UC Santa Barbara (June 2023 - Present)

As a post-baccalaureate research assistant for the CPLS Lab, I am conducting research that validates the Functional Load Hypothesis -- the theory that sounds distinguishing more words are less likely to disappear from a language or merge with other sounds. Using Word2Vec embeddings trained on the carefully selected corpora of nine languages, we are able to quantify the extent to which words differing by one sound, that is, minimal pairs, may be confused with each other in context and compared to a simple count of words. This important linguistic theory provides insight on how languages may evolve overtime.

#### Capstone Researcher

Evidation Health, Inc. (January 2023 - June 2023)

This project was a collaboration with Evidation to investigate alternative diagnostic metrics for respiratory viral infections (RVI). Using data collected from Fitbit devices, such as an individual's resting heart rate and caloric expenditure, we designed a boosted tree model that was able to predict the outcome of the participant's RVI lab test result and their hypothesized recovery interval. This project was presented at the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Long Beach, CA.

#### Undergraduate Data Science Fellow

Central Coast Data Science Partnership (September 2022 - June 2023)

As part of a cohort, I led outreach programs aimed at inspiring students and promoting departmental courses to a diverse student body. At the end of the academic year, I helped to organize and present at the Department of Probability and Statistics Project Showcase.

### Other Endeavors

#### Medical Transcription Simplification Using BERT

April 2023 - June 2023

Using synonym replacement and text summarization, my team and I explored the methodology of medical transcription simplification and set out to define readability of documents. Our results indicated that our synonym replacement and summarization were successful in increasing the readability of medical transcriptions by reducing the Flesch-Kincaid metric, effectively democratizing information contained in these transcriptions. This project took on two phases: synonym simplification and summarization. In the first phase, we computed cosine similarities between BioBert embeddings derived from Harvard Health medical definitions and context dependent terminology found in the transcriptions to discover synonym substitutions. The second phase employed Bert2Bert to summarize and further refine the overall documents.

#### Yelp Classification Modeling

September 2022 - December 2022

Written in the style of a follow-along blog post, I set out to assess the relationship between geographic attributes of a food-related business and their reviews. Referencing the Bing Sentiment Lexicon in R, I extracted text dependent information that encapsulated how reviewers felt beyond their star ratings. After extensive data collection on both the businesses and reviews, I trained 4 machine learning methods to identify key predictors for defining a business's location within the Santa Barbara county. The number of reviews, review ratings, and votes on reviews proved to be the most important factors in a business's rating, illuminating both the importance of business location but also the pitfalls of star ratings derived from averages.
