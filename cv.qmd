### Research Experience

#### Post-baccalaureate Research Assistant

UC Santa Barbara (June 2023 - Present)

As a post-baccalaureate research assistant for the CPLS Lab, I am conducting research that validates the Functional Load Hypothesis -- the theory that sounds distinguishing more words are less likely to disappear from a language or merge with other sounds. Using Word2Vec embeddings trained on the carefully selected corpora of nine languages, we are able to quantify the extent to which words differing by one sound, that is, minimal pairs, may be confused with each other in context and compared to a simple count of words. This important linguistic theory provides insight on how languages may evolve overtime.

#### Capstone Researcher

Evidation Health, Inc. (January 2023 - June 2023)

This project was a collaboration with Evidation to investigate alternative diagnostic metrics for respiratory viral infections (RVI). Using data collected from Fitbit devices, such as an individual's resting heart rate and caloric expenditure, we designed a boosted tree model that was able to predict the outcome of the participant's RVI lab test result and their hypothesized recovery interval. This project was presented at the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Long Beach, CA.

#### Undergraduate Data Science Fellow

Central Coast Data Science Partnership (September 2022 - June 2023)

As part of a cohort, I led outreach programs aimed at inspiring students and promoting departmental courses to a diverse student body. At the end of the academic year, I helped to organize and present at the Department of Probability and Statistics Project Showcase.

### Other Endeavors
#### Entity Aware Machine Translation

To mitigate the effects that a named entity can have during translation, a named entity translation lookup was implemented, paired with code-switching to reintegrate the translated entity back into the original source sentence. The modified sentence, containing the translated entity, was then processed by a translation model. Using a Seq2Seq and Transformer model, the approach achieved COMET scores of 63 and 68, respectively, with the Transformer model outperforming mBart. These findings will be submitted to the SemEval 2025 workshop.

#### Penn Treebank Model Generation

A decoder-only language model is created to generate sentences from the Penn Treebank dataset. This model achieves a perplexity of 269, compared to GPT-2 which gets around 65.

#### IOB Slot Tagging for Move Relations

October 2024 - November 2024

This is a continuation of the previous project and addresses IOB slot tag classification using two sequential models: A bidirectional LSTM and its simpler counterpart, the bidirectional GRU model. The hyperparameters of the two models are tailored in such a way to get better validation loss and F1 scores.

#### Movie Relation Classification

September 2024 - October 2024

Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning play a crucial role in machine learning algorithms. In constructing a model to predict relations for a given movie-related utterance, feature engineering proved to be an effective method for improving accuracy. The usage of dense vector embeddings, batch data processing, data shuffling, and data resampling increased validation accuracy by 3%. Hyperparameter tuning, such as increasing the learning rate and decreasing regularization, boosted validation accuracy to 96% and test accuracy to 81%.

#### Medical Transcription Simplification Using BERT

April 2023 - June 2023

Using synonym replacement and text summarization, my team and I explored the methodology of medical transcription simplification and set out to define readability of documents. Our results indicated that our synonym replacement and summarization were successful in increasing the readability of medical transcriptions by reducing the Flesch-Kincaid metric, effectively democratizing information contained in these transcriptions. This project took on two phases: synonym simplification and summarization. In the first phase, we computed cosine similarities between BioBert embeddings derived from Harvard Health medical definitions and context dependent terminology found in the transcriptions to discover synonym substitutions. The second phase employed Bert2Bert to summarize and further refine the overall documents.

#### Yelp Classification Modeling

September 2022 - December 2022

Written in the style of a follow-along blog post, I set out to assess the relationship between geographic attributes of a food-related business and their reviews. Referencing the Bing Sentiment Lexicon in R, I extracted text dependent information that encapsulated how reviewers felt beyond their star ratings. After extensive data collection on both the businesses and reviews, I trained 4 machine learning methods to identify key predictors for defining a business's location within the Santa Barbara county. The number of reviews, review ratings, and votes on reviews proved to be the most important factors in a business's rating, illuminating both the importance of business location but also the pitfalls of star ratings derived from averages.
